    <span class="sub_ttl_gray">Chapter 1</span><br/>
        <div class="title">INTRODUCTION</div>
            <p>Bangladesh is a developing country, and the present government is striving relentlessly to attain rapid economic development in the country. Many programs taken so far have been carried out successfully. Despite a lack of resources faced by the government, development programs in the key sectors have continued. At the same time, considering the importance of the private sector, an all-out support is being provided to initiatives taken in this sector. As a result, a new kind of dynamism is under way in both th~ public and private sectors. In this backdrop, it is essential to examine various aspects of industrialization and its impacts on overall economic activities.</p>
            <p>Given the present environment of global competition, the private sector is playing an important role in the industrialization of the country. Therefore, the Government in the Ministry of Industries has taken the role of a facilitator. Faced with the challenges of the free market economy and globalization, the government has accepted private ownership and management of industrial enterprises as one of the major guiding forces in achieving economic growth. Besides this, the government has also brought about many constructive and timely reforms in the running of businesses, and liberalized trade so that private entrepreneurs can seize opportunities of establishing and running industrial enterprises profitably and freely </p>
            <p>In the meantime, quite a number of publicly managed industrial enterprises have already been sold out and transferred to private ownership. In order to establish economically prospective industries in industrial sub-sectors, there are plans to set up industrial parks and special economic zones so that huge amount. of unused and abandoned land can be utilized. All this is aimed at fostering industrialization and economic development and generating employment opportunities in the country. </p>
            <p>To reduce poverty and generate employment opportunities, more efforts are needed to establish agro-based industries as well as to raise agricultural production.. This will ensure the protection and fair price of agricultural products and employment of a huge number of unemployed people. In order. to create further employment opportunities beyond the agricultural sector, initiatives should be taken to set up small, medium and large industries across the country. If these types of industries are set up in a planned way, then unemployment rates will decline and poverty alleviation will be accelerated. With these objectives in mind, the Industrial Policy has been radically reshaped. </p>
            <p>In order to provide administrative, institutional and infrastructure facilities in the country's industrialization, there are organizations such as the Bangladesh Stranded and Testing Institution (BSTI), Bangladesh Industrial Technical Assistance Center (BIT AC), Bangladesh Institute of Management (BIM), Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), National Productivity Organization (NPO) and Small and Cottage Industries Training Institute (SCITI) under the Ministry of Industries, and the National Institute of Textile Training, Research and Design (NITTRED), Textile Vocational Institutes, Textile Diploma Institute and Bangladesh Silk Research and Training Institutes </p>
            <p>Under the Ministry of Textiles and Jute. For the leather industry, the Bangladesh college of Leather Technology and different district level polytechnic institutes provide technical education. These institutes also provide assistance for industrialization by providing training on management and quality control of goods, safeguarding consumers' interests, producing and repairing import-substitute spare-parts used in industries, manufacturing new tools necessary for the production of industrial goods that are in demand, and by improving efficiency and overall productivity. However, many industrial entrepreneurs are not fully aware of the necessary technical and other assistance available for the industrial sector through these institutes. Theref0re, extensive publicity is necessary for the proper use of these important institutes and the facilities available there. </p>
            <p>In order to' further strengthen the country's industrialization process, the present&quot; government has identified the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as a priority sector and as the driving force for industrialization. A national taskforce led by the Principal Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office has been formed so that proper policies and planning are followed in establishing SMEs. At the same time, with a view to providing entrepreneurs with assistance in the establishment of SMEs, a cell has been created under the supervision of the Ministry of Industries comprising officials experienced in SMEs from the Ministry of Industries, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), National Productivity Organization (NPO), Asian Development Bank (ADB), FBCCI, National Association of Small and Cottage Industries, Bangladesh (NASCIB) and women entrepreneurs. </p>
            <p>The provisions of all facilities for attracting foreign investments have been envisaged in the Industrial Policy. The government has taken an initiative to formulate a separate SME policy to provide entrepreneurs with necessary guidance and strategic support in respect of the establishment of SME industries all over the country. These strategic guidelines will be followed in establishing SMEs across the country. </p>
            <p>Far-reaching changes have occurred in the past decade in economic and social activities across the globe, especially with regard to the participation, contributions and successes of women in industrial activities. Therefore, the creation of women entrepreneurs and their participation in industrialization have been given considerable prominence in the present Industrial Policy. </p>
            <p>Necessary steps have been taken to hygienically preserve and market agricultural products of Bangladesh. With this end in view, measures will be taken for the preservation of frozen, pasteurized, canned and dry foods in a modern and hygienic way 'in order to sell them in local and overseas markets throughout the year. </p>
            <p>Steps will be taken to properly utilize the natural and mineral resources of the country such as gas, coal, hard rock, limestone, silicon, monazite, zircon, rutile, oyster, pearl, coral1 fossil, seaweeds, etc, available in the country's long sea-beach so that new profitable industries can be set up. Steps will also be taken at the same time to use solar power and municipal refuse to generate electric power in order to minimize power shortage in running small and cottage industries. </p>
            <p>This is an age of information and communication technology (ICT). The application of ICT in running industrial enterprises efficiently and profitably can ensure quality development of goods, make production cost-effective and ensure faster customer services. So, providing further importance and incentives to the use of ICT in a number of sectors is one of the notable features of the present Industrial Policy. </p>
            <p>The industrial sector is likely to grow rapidly over the next decade raising its contribution to the country's GDP to 30 to 35 percent, and the workforce in this sector is expected to increase to 35 percent of national employment need. In order to attain this growth in this sector, special importance has been given in the Industrial Policy on agro-based and agro processing industries and on steps to overcome possible adverse conditions in the export oriented garment sector. Importance has also been given on considering the SMEs and cottage industries as one of the major driving forces, providing assistance to women entrepreneurs on a priority basis, setting up special economic zones in different parts of the country, improving the quality of industrial products to world standard, marketing of goods at competitive prices, and enhancing productivity in the industrial sector </p>
            <p>There is a proposal in the Industrial Policy for the formation of a high level committee led by Minister of Industries and comprising senior officials from public and private organizations involved in industrialization. This committee will submit a report to the Cabinet for its decisive approval, and afterwards the relevant ministries/divisions/ agencies will take necessary programs for industrialization to get underway in the approved sectors. </p>
            <p>In the end, it can be hoped that the guidelines contained in the new Industrial Policy will help expand planned industrialization in the country, bring about sustainable and continuous industrial growth, and overcome the past failures of industrialization to a great extent. As a result, a sound and prospective foundation of economic development will be established. This will help bring about poverty alleviation, create further employment opportunities, reduce unemployment instances, improve living standards of people, and achieve an overall economic growth in the country.<br/></p>

            <p>4.1 Broadly speaking, industry includes manufacturing and service activities</p>
            <p>4.2 Production, processing and assembling, and rehabilitation and fabrication of manufactured goods are included in industry.</p>
            <p>4.3 The services that are received through the use of machinery and durable resources. are included in the service industries. The service industries have been enlisted in Annex-2.</p>
            <p>4.4 Definitions of industries in the manufacturing sector:
            (a)"Large Industry" means an industry in which the value/replacement cost of durable resources other than land and factory buildings is above 100 million taka.

            (b) "Medium Industry" means an industry in which the value/replacement cost of durable resources other than land and factory buildings is between 15 million and 100 million taka.

            (c) "Small Industry" means an industry in which the value/replacement cost of durable resources other than land and factory buildings is under 15 million taka.

            (d) "Cottage industry" means an industry in which members of a family are engaged part-time or full-time in production and service-oriented activities.</p>

            <p> 4.5 Definitions of industries in the non-manufacturing sector (trading and other services):

            c) "Small Industry" means an industry in which fewer than 25 workers work(unlike family members in a cottage industry).


            Reserved industries:			</p>
            <p>4.6


            Those industries that are necessary to be kept reserved by the government in the interest of national security and are sensitive have been identified as reserved industries. A list of reserved industries has been given in Annex-3


            Thrust sector: </p>
            <p>4.7


            The thrust sector will mean those industries/industrial sub-sectors which have already been able to successfully contribute to the country's industrialization and poverty alleviation by increasing GDP, creating employment opportunities and increasing export income.

The facilities provided to those industries that are established in EPZ areas includingexport-oriented industries can also be provided to the thrust sector. The objective will be to use domestic technology, import substitution, adjustment and/or export augmentation. But entrepreneurs under the thrust sector will not receive these facilities automatically. The government will determine the facilities to be received by thrust sector entrepreneurs after analysing and reviewing the performances and contributions of their sub-sectors/industrial enterprises to the national economy. A list of the thrust sector has been given in Annex-1.</p>
            <p> 4.8

            <p>7.1


            There will be no differences between the same types of industries established in the public and private sectors in respect of customs duty and other taxes.		</p>
            <p>7.2


            (a) As of today, the tax holiday facility will be provided till the end of 2005 on the basis of the locations of industrial enterprises. After that time, this facility will depend on what the government decides in this regard. However, tax holiday will not be applicable for extended units of industrial enterprises. At least 40% of the tax-free income must be invested.
            <br/>
            (b) As an alternative to tax holiday, industrial enterprises will receive depreciation at the rate of 100% in the first year. Apart from this, industrial enterprises receiving tax holiday will be entitled to 80% depreciation in the second year and 20% depreciation in the third year for their extended unit plants and machinery.
            <br/>
            (c) If the tax holiday and tax relief facilities cannot be provided for setting up new industries in the future, then taxation at a reduced rate will be considered.
            <br/>
            (d) Agro-processing industries and computer software businesses will receive income tax relief from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2006.

            <p>7.3


            The present structure of duty concession on machinery imports will continue. Imported machinery and spare parts will be exempt from payment of V AT subject to existing conditions. In addition to other incentives schemes, activities of the Equity and Entrepreneurship Fund (EEF) will be intensified to give priority to entrepreneurs of under-developed areas and entrepreneurs of the BSCIC industrial enclaves in receiving loans from this fund. </p>
            <p>7.4


            The duty structures of imported raw materials, intermediate goods and manufactured goods will be set at gradually escalating rates. </p>
            <p>7.5


            In order to eliminate unequal competitions between goods produced at home and goods imported, the prevailing duty structures will be made reasonable, if necessary. If any items are illegally imported at a dumping price - a price that is unjustified and below the production costs, then with recommendations from the Bangladesh Tariff Commission, the anti-dumping law will be applied and counter-veiling duty imposed.			</p>
            <p>7.6


            Industrial enterprises established outside the EPZs, and industrial units with 100% foreign investments, joint ventures (Type B) and local ventures may conclude foreign exchange related agreements with foreign creditors with the prior approval of the Board of Investment. 100% foreign owned industrial units (Type A) situated in that area can take credit from abroad without prior approval.

            <p>7.8


            Special revenue facilities (as described in Section 4.7) will be provided to industries marked as "thrust sectors", SMEs and cottage industries		</p>
            <p>7.9


            Industrial enterprises registered with the Board of Investment need not pay any transfer fee and gains tax to purchase land for setting up new industries or to transform an industry into a limited company provided that no changes can be made in the ownership structure after that transfer.		</p>
            <p>7.10


            Steps will be taken to create an industry fund in the Bangladesh Bank, strengthen specialized banks, establish a country fund, expand the capital market, create an endeavour fund, and rationalize the tax holiday system.

        <div class="title">MASSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF SMALL, MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES) AND COTTAGE INDUSTRIES IN COUNTRYWIDE INDUSTRIALIZATION</div>
            <p> 8.1


            The development and expansion of SMEs is regarded as a very important medium of achieving industrialization and economic growth in both developed and developing countries. The role of SMEs in industrial revolution in the industrialized world was enormous, and this trend has continued to-date. The role of SMEs in generating investment, savings, profit, employment opportunities, export, regional industrialization and improvement of people's living standards as well as national development is very important. To this end, forward linkage, backward linkage, value addition activities and productivity improvement should be accelerated in order to establish and expand SMEs in the manufacturing sector. As such the SME sector has been treated as a priority sector in the Industrial Policy 2005.


            SCOPE OF SMES </p>
            <p>8.2


            The structural arrangements of Bangladesh's industries show that jute, textiles, paper, steel and engineering, cement, chemical, fertilizer and pharmaceutical industries are under the big and medium scale industries. On the other hand, specialized textile industries (including garments), backward linkage industries, hand-operated welding, food processing and food linkage industries, leather, ceramics, light engineering including automobiles, basic metal engineering, small scale chemical engineering, rubber industries, paper printing and publishing industries, small fabrication industries, non-metal mineral products, batteries, electrical, electronics, handicrafts, agro-based industries, multilateral jute goods, silk industries, fruit processing, poultry farming, fisheries, tea-gardening and processing, vegetable seed farming, floriculture and agro-forestry, and printing industries, ginning and baling, construction industries, transportation (including automobiles), cinema and photography, pathological laboratories, cold storage, furniture, computer industries, fast food, frozen food, etc, under service industries, and many other sectors are included in the SMEs.		</p>
            <p>8.3


            SMEs will be established on a greater scale across the country in order to bring about poverty alleviation, unemployment reduction and creating more employment opportunity so that national economic growth can be attained. To this end, the government has taken an initiative to draw up a separate SME policy with a view to providing necessary guidelines and strategic assistance in respect of establishing SMEs throughout the country. The guidelines and strategy incorporated in the relevant policies will be pursued in establishing and expanding SMEs of all kinds throughout the country.</p>

    <span class="sub_ttl_gray"> Chapter 9			  </span><br/>

        <div class="title">ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES BASED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INDUSTRIES, AVAILABILITY OF INPUT SAND REGIONAL FACILITIES. </div>
            <p>9.1


            In some of the Asian and Pacific countries, such as Taiwan, China, Singapore and Malaysia, industrial enterprises have been established in various regions considering their socioeconomic conditions and importance, and economic arid commercial opportunities on the basis of the availability of various facilities.

            Many other countries across the world are pursuing this concept. The setting up of special economic zones in Bangladesh considering the socioeconomic background and facilities available in various regions is equally important.			</p>
            <p>9.2


            Because this concept to a great extent is cost-effective and economically profitable, special economic zones will be established across Bangladesh on a priority basis considering the nature and types of industries and comparative costs across regIOns </p>
            <p>9.3


            A considerable size of land has remained unproductive because of salinity and infertility in a number of regions in the country. On the other hand, the labor-and creative working capacity of a great number of efficient people cannot be utilized because of lack of opportunity. Therefore, initiatives will be taken to establish and run industries profitably in special economic zones on the basis of facilities available in various regions so that unused land, human and other resources can be properly used.		</p>
            <p>9.4


            By creating special economic zones, cluster villages can be established quickly for running industrial enterprises. Cluster villages can be set up in especial economic zones for industries such as leather industries, hosiery industries, small chemical industries (paint, varnish, etc), dyeing, printing and finishing, electronics, electrical goods, handicrafts, boutique, etc.			</p>
            <p>9.5


            As a foremost strategy for maintaining balance in the country's economic development, initiatives will be taken to set up industrial enterprises on a limited scale and on a trial basis in economic zones.			</p>

            <p>10.3


            It has been proposed that the month of January will henceforth be observed as the productivity month with a view to strengthening productivity enhancing activities in all industrial enterprises and institutions. The aim is to continue a positive productivity enhancing effort in the industrial sector throughout the year.			</p>
            <p>10.4


            In recognition of success in manufacturing quality goods of international standard and successful running of an industrial enterprise, a national "Excellence in Productivity and Quality" award will be given every year from now on to an institution which will achieve the highest productivity records			</p>
            <p>10.5


            A separate policy entitled "Productivity Policy" will be drawn up which will

            provide help to and exert influence on developing productivity in the country.		</p>
            <p>10.6


            To ensure application of productivity enhancement strategies in all industrial enterprises and institutions, productivity-training programs for human resources development will be conducted at the enterprise level.		</p>
            <p>10.7


            In its regular broadcasts, Bangladesh Television and Radio Bangladesh will stress the importance of productivity and announce the positive results, so that people around the country become more conscious and interested in it.		</p>

            <p>10.11


            The necessity for developing proper workers-management relations in the industrial sector will be upheld, and if necessary, some of the sections of the present labor law will be reformed in line with recommendations of the Labour Law Commission, as committed to the ILO, so that necessary steps can be taken to improve industrial relations. </p>
            <p>10.12


            Collective bargaining will be given priority in fixing wage. </p>
            <p>10.13


            The Tripartite Consultation Council (the government, owners and the trade union), National Productivity Council and other national-level organizations will help the government formulate policies on employment expansion, productivity enhancement, training, efficiency development, etc.

            10.14

        <div class="title">PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDUSTRIALIZATION AND THEIR ADVANCEMENT		</div>
            <p>11.1


            Over the last decade, there have been substantial progress in women's participation and successes in socioeconomic activities, especially in industrial activities, in Bangladesh as elsewhere in the world. So, women's participation in the country's industrialization must be ensured on a wider scale		</p>
            <p>11.2


            Special emphasis will be given to identify women entrepreneurs capable of running independent and self-sufficient industries and businesses all across the country.		</p>
            <p>11.3


            Necessary steps will be taken to provide women entrepreneurs with pre-investment advice and assistance in drawing up and implementing projects.		</p>
            <p>11.4


            Various incentives and financial support will be considered for women entrepreneurs to get established in small and cottage industries.</p>
            <p> 11.5


            Technical, financial and training assistance will be provided for establishing. SMEs considering the social stance and status of women entrepreneurs. Modern technical training will be arranged for enhancing the efficiency of women entrepreneurs in cooperation with different institutions established under the Ministry of Industries, such as BSCIC, BIT AC, BIM, NPO, and SCITI.		</p>
            <p>11.6


            Women entrepreneurs will be given preference in expanding and achieving growth in service industries.</p>
            <p> 11.7


            Women entrepreneurs will be encouraged on a greater scale in setting up and running agro-based industries in the country. Similarly, women entrepreneurs will be given technical and financial assistance in establishing garment (knit and woven), electronic, ceramic, hosiery, frozen food, cold storage and high value added industries.		</p>
            <p>11.8


            Women entrepreneurs will be provided with incentives and financial assistance in establishing cottage industries of decorative items, leather goods, embroidery, imitation items, block, boutique, handicrafts of bamboo and cane, toys and other gift items.		</p>
            <p>11.9


            In order to create women entrepreneurs of high standard, opportunities will be generated for advanced training and necessary capital, and successful implementation of projects will be ensured to set up SMEs and cottage industries. With this end in view, a number of plots will be reserved for women entrepreneurs in industrial parks in all divisional towns of the country.		</p>
            <p>11.10


            Necessary initiatives will be taken to help improve the standard of goods produced by women entrepreneurs, create new markets, publicize, promote and sell their products in local and foreign markets.		</p>

        <div class="title">Investment Criteria of Feasibility Study for Planned &nbsp;Industrialization		</div>
            <p>12.1


            Because of the scarcity of capital in the country, financing institutions investing in the industrial sector have to conduct pre-investment study properly. With this end in view, the investment criteria that are suitable should be examined and then applied. Special care should be taken in respect of big and medium scale industries because they require big amount of capital to be invested. While setting up large and medium scale industries, entrepreneurs and. financing institutions should consider improving the conventional investment tactics, exalting and review the different investment criteria, and then conduct the feasibility study on the basis of that criterion which is most suitable. If necessary, more than one criterion can be used to conduct feasibility study. Investment criteria have been explained in brief in Annex 4.			</p>
            <p>12.2


            Creating re-investment opportunities in manufacturing goods in the industrial sector is an important factor. So, production activities in the industrial sector should be administered in such a way those re-investment opportunities are created. </p>
            <p>12.3


            The principles of productivity gain sharing are appropriately followed in many developed and developing countries in order to attain continuous growth in the production sector. The objective is to distribute profit between workers, owners and the government on an equal basis. This concept can also be pursued in running industrial enterprises in our country. To this end, a minimum productivity standard should be set in each industrial enterprise.		</p>
