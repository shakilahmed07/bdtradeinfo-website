<p>OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit</p>

<p>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast</p>

<p>Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</p>

<p>With loss of <em>Eden</em>, till one greater Man</p>

<p>Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,</p>

<p>Sing Heav&#39;nly Muse, that on the secret top</p>

<p>Of <em>Oreb</em>, or of <em>Sinai</em>, didst inspire</p>

<p>That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,</p>

<p>In the Beginning how the Heav&#39;ns and Earth</p>

<p>Rose out of <em>Chaos</em>: or if <em>Sion</em> Hill</p>

<p>Delight thee more, and <em>Siloa&#39;</em>s brook that flow&#39;d</p>

<p>Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence</p>

<p>Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,</p>

<p>That with no middle flight intends to soar</p>

<p>Above th&#39; <em>Aonian</em> Mount, while it pursues</p>

<p>Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.</p>

<p>And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer</p>

<p>Before all Temples th&#39; upright heart and pure,</p>

<p>Instruct me, for Thou know&#39;st; Thou from the first</p>

<p>Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread</p>

<p>Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</p>

<p>And mad&#39;st it pregnant: What in me is dark</p>

<p>Illumin, what is low raise and support;</p>

<p>That to the highth of this great Argument</p>

<p>I may assert Eternal Providence,</p>

<p>And justifie the wayes of God to men.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Say first, for Heav&#39;n hides nothing from thy view</p>

<p>Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</p>

<p>Mov&#39;d our Grand Parents in that happy State,</p>

<p>Favour&#39;d of Heav&#39;n so highly, to fall off</p>

<p>From thir Creator, and transgress his Will</p>

<p>For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?</p>

<p>Who first seduc&#39;d them to that foul revolt?</p>

<p>Th&#39; infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile</p>

<p>Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv&#39;d</p>

<p>The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride</p>

<p>Had cast him out from Heav&#39;n, with all his Host</p>

<p>Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring</p>

<p>To set himself in Glory above his Peers,</p>

<p>He trusted to have equal&#39;d the most High,</p>

<p>If he oppos&#39;d; and with ambitious aim</p>

<p>Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</p>

<p>Rais&#39;d impious War in Heav&#39;n and Battel proud</p>

<p>With vain attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him the Almighty Power</p>

<p>Hurld headlong flaming from th&#39; Ethereal Skie</p>

<p>With hideous ruine and combustion down</p>

<p>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</p>

<p>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,</p>

<p>Who durst defie th&#39; Omnipotent to Arms.</p>

<p>Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night</p>

<p>To mortal men, he with his horrid crew</p>

<p>Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe</p>

<p>Confounded though immortal: But his doom</p>

<p>Reserv&#39;d him to more wrath; for now the thought</p>

<p>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</p>

<p>Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes</p>

<p>That witness&#39;d huge affliction and dismay</p>

<p>Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:</p>

<p>At once as far as Angels kenn he views</p>

<p>The dismal Situation waste and wilde,</p>

<p>A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round</p>

<p>As one great Furnace flam&#39;d, yet from those flames</p>

<p>No light, but rather darkness visible</p>

<p>Serv&#39;d onely to discover sights of woe,</p>

<p>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</p>

<p>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</p>

<p>That comes to all; but torture without end</p>

<p>Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed</p>

<p>With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&#39;d:</p>

<p>Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&#39;d</p>

<p>For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained</p>

<p>In utter darkness, and thir portion set</p>

<p>As far remov&#39;d from God and light of Heav&#39;n</p>

<p>As from the Center thrice to th&#39; utmost Pole.</p>

<p>O how unlike the place from whence they fell!</p>

<p>There the companions of his fall, o&#39;rewhelm&#39;d</p>

<p>With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</p>

<p>He soon discerns, and weltring by his side</p>

<p>One next himself in power, and next in crime,</p>

<p>Long after known in <em>Palestine</em>, and nam&#39;d</p>

<p><em>Beelzebub</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom th&#39; Arch-Enemy,</p>

<p>And thence in Heav&#39;n call&#39;d Satan, with bold words</p>

<p>Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If thou beest he; But O how fall&#39;n! how chang&#39;d</p>

<p>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light</p>

<p>Cloth&#39;d with transcendent brightness didst out-shine</p>

<p>Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,</p>

<p>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope</p>

<p>And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,</p>

<p>Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd</p>

<p>In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest</p>

<p>From what highth fall&#39;n, so much the stronger prov&#39;d</p>

<p>He with his Thunder: and till then who knew</p>

<p>The force of those dire Arms?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet not for those,</p>

<p>Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage</p>

<p>Can else inflict, do I repent or change,</p>

<p>Though chang&#39;d in outward lustre; that fixt mind</p>

<p>And high disdain, from sence of injur&#39;d merit,</p>

<p>That with the mightiest rais&#39;d me to contend,</p>

<p>And to the fierce contention brought along</p>

<p>Innumerable force of Spirits arm&#39;d</p>

<p>That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</p>

<p>His utmost power with adverse power oppos&#39;d</p>

<p>In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav&#39;n,</p>

<p>And shook his throne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What though the field be lost?</p>

<p>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</p>

<p>And study of revenge, immortal hate,</p>

<p>And courage never to submit or yield:</p>

<p>And what is else not to be overcome?</p>

<p>That Glory never shall his wrath or might</p>

<p>Extort from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bow and sue for grace</p>

<p>With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,</p>

<p>Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</p>

<p>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</p>

<p>That were an ignominy and shame beneath</p>

<p>This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</p>

<p>And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</p>

<p>Since through experience of this great event</p>

<p>In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc&#39;t,</p>

<p>We may with more successful hope resolve</p>

<p>To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</p>

<p>Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</p>

<p>Who now triumphs, and in th&#39; excess of joy</p>

<p>Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav&#39;n.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So spake th&#39; Apostate Angel, though in pain,</p>

<p>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</p>

<p>And him thus answer&#39;d soon his bold Compeer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,</p>

<p>That led th&#39; imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</p>

<p>Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</p>

<p>Fearless, endanger&#39;d Heav&#39;ns perpetual King;</p>

<p>And put to proof his high Supremacy,</p>

<p>Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</p>

<p>Too well I see and rue the dire event,</p>

<p>That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</p>

<p>Hath lost us Heav&#39;n, and all this mighty Host</p>

<p>In horrible destruction laid thus low,</p>

<p>As far as Gods and Heav&#39;nly Essences</p>

<p>Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains</p>

<p>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</p>

<p>Though all our Glory extinct and happy state</p>

<p>Here swallow&#39;d up in endless misery.</p>

<p>But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</p>

<p>Of force believe Almighty, since no less</p>

<p>Then such could hav orepow&#39;rd such force as ours)</p>

<p>Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</p>

<p>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</p>

<p>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</p>

<p>Or do him mightier service as his thralls</p>

<p>By right of Warr, what e&#39;re his business be</p>

<p>Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</p>

<p>Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</p>

<p>What can it then avail though yet we feel</p>

<p>Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</p>

<p>To undergo eternal punishment?</p>

<p>Whereto with speedy words th&#39; Arch-fiend reply&#39;d.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fall&#39;n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</p>

<p>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</p>

<p>To do ought good never will be our task,</p>

<p>But ever to do ill our sole delight,</p>

<p>As being the contrary to his high will</p>

<p>Whom we resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then his Providence</p>

<p>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</p>

<p>Our labour must be to pervert that end,</p>

<p>And out of good still to find means of evil;</p>

<p>Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</p>

<p>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</p>

<p>His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.</p>

<p>But see the angry Victor hath recall&#39;d</p>

<p>His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</p>

<p>Back to the Gates of Heav&#39;n: the Sulphurous Hail</p>

<p>Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</p>

<p>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</p>

<p>Of Heav&#39;n receiv&#39;d us falling, and the Thunder,</p>

<p>Wing&#39;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</p>

<p>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</p>

<p>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</p>

<p>Let us not slip th&#39; occasion, whether scorn,</p>

<p>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</p>

<p>Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</p>

<p>The seat of desolation, voyd of light,</p>

<p>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</p>

<p>Casts pale and dreadful?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither let us tend</p>

<p>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</p>

<p>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</p>

<p>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</p>

<p>Consult how we may henceforth most offend</p>

<p>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,</p>

<p>How overcome this dire Calamity,</p>

<p>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,</p>

<p>If not what resolution from despare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus Satan to his neerest Mate</p>

<p>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</p>

<p>That sparkling blaz&#39;d, his other Parts besides</p>

<p>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large</p>

<p>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</p>

<p>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,</p>

<p><em>Titanian</em>, or <em>Earth-born</em>, that warr&#39;d on <em>Jove</em>,</p>

<p><em>Briareos</em> or <em>Typhon</em>, whom the Den</p>

<p>By ancient <em>Tarsus</em> held, or that Sea-beast</p>

<p><em>Leviathan</em>, which God of all his works</p>

<p>Created hugest that swim th&#39; Ocean stream:</p>

<p>Him haply slumbring on the <em>Norway</em> foam</p>

<p>The Pilot of some small night-founder&#39;d Skiff,</p>

<p>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,</p>

<p>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind</p>

<p>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night</p>

<p>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:</p>

<p>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay</p>

<p>Chain&#39;d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence</p>

<p>Had ris&#39;n or heav&#39;d his head, but that the will</p>

<p>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</p>

<p>Left him at large to his own dark designs,</p>

<p>That with reiterated crimes he might</p>

<p>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</p>

<p>Evil to others, and enrag&#39;d might see</p>

<p>How all his malice serv&#39;d but to bring forth</p>

<p>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</p>

<p>On Man by him seduc&#39;t, but on himself</p>

<p>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour&#39;d.</p>

<p>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</p>

<p>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</p>

<p>Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld</p>

<p>In billows, leave i&#39;th&#39;midst a horrid Vale.</p>

<p>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight</p>

<p>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air</p>

<p>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</p>

<p>He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn&#39;d</p>

<p>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</p>

<p>And such appear&#39;d in hue, as when the force</p>

<p>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill</p>

<p>Torn from <em>Pelorus</em>, or the shatter&#39;d side</p>

<p>Of thundring <em>Aetna</em>, whose combustible</p>

<p>And fewel&#39;d entrals thence conceiving Fire,</p>

<p>Sublim&#39;d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,</p>

<p>And leave a singed bottom all involv&#39;d</p>

<p>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole</p>

<p>Of unblest feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him followed his next Mate,</p>

<p>Both glorying to have scap&#39;t the <em>Stygian</em> flood</p>

<p>As Gods, and by thir own recover&#39;d strength,</p>

<p>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,</p>

<p>Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat</p>

<p>That we must change for Heav&#39;n, this mournful gloom</p>

<p>For that celestial light?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it so, since he</p>

<p>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid</p>

<p>What shall be right: fardest from him his best</p>

<p>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream</p>

<p>Above his equals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewel happy Fields</p>

<p>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail</p>

<p>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</p>

<p>Receive thy new Possessor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One who brings</p>

<p>A mind not to be chang&#39;d by Place or Time.</p>

<p>The mind is its own place, and in it self</p>

<p>Can make a Heav&#39;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&#39;n.</p>

<p>What matter where, if I be still the same,</p>

<p>And what I should be, all but less then he</p>

<p>Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least</p>

<p>We shall be free; th&#39; Almighty hath not built</p>

<p>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:</p>

<p>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce</p>

<p>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</p>

<p>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&#39;n.</p>

<p>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,</p>

<p>Th&#39; associates and copartners of our loss</p>

<p>Lye thus astonisht on th&#39; oblivious Pool,</p>

<p>And call them not to share with us their part</p>

<p>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more</p>

<p>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet</p>

<p>Regaind in Heav&#39;n, or what more lost in Hell?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So <em>Satan</em> spake, and him <em>Beelzebub</em></p>

<p>Thus answer&#39;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leader of those Armies bright,</p>

<p>Which but th&#39; Omnipotent none could have foyld,</p>

<p>If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge</p>

<p>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft</p>

<p>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge</p>

<p>Of battel when it rag&#39;d, in all assaults</p>

<p>Thir surest signal, they will soon resume</p>

<p>New courage and revive, though now they lye</p>

<p>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,</p>

<p>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz&#39;d,</p>

<p>No wonder, fall&#39;n such a pernicious highth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He scarce had ceas&#39;t when the superiour Fiend</p>

<p>Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield</p>

<p>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,</p>

<p>Behind him cast; the broad circumference</p>

<p>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb</p>

<p>Through Optic Glass the <em>Tuscan</em> Artist views</p>

<p>At Ev&#39;ning from the top of <em>Fesole</em>,</p>

<p>Or in <em>Valdarno</em>, to descry new Lands,</p>

<p>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.</p>

<p>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine</p>

<p>Hewn on <em>Norwegian</em> hills, to be the Mast</p>

<p>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,</p>

<p>He walkt with to support uneasie steps</p>

<p>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps</p>

<p>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime</p>

<p>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;</p>

<p>Nathless he so endur&#39;d, till on the Beach</p>

<p>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call&#39;d</p>

<p>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans&#39;t</p>

<p>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks</p>

<p>In <em>Vallombrosa</em>, where th&#39; <em>Etrurian</em> shades</p>

<p>High overarch&#39;t imbowr; or scatterd sedge</p>

<p>Afloat, when with fierce Winds <em>Orion</em> arm&#39;d</p>

<p>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew</p>

<p><em>Busirus</em> and his <em>Memphian</em> Chivalry,</p>

<p>While with perfidious hatred they pursu&#39;d</p>

<p>The Sojourners of <em>Goshen</em>, who beheld</p>

<p>From the safe shore thir floating Carkases</p>

<p>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown</p>

<p>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,</p>

<p>Under amazement of thir hideous change.</p>

<p>He call&#39;d so loud, that all the hollow Deep</p>

<p>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates</p>

<p>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav&#39;n, once yours, now lost,</p>

<p>If such astonishment as this can sieze</p>

<p>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos&#39;n this place</p>

<p>After the toyl of Battel to repose</p>

<p>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find</p>

<p>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav&#39;n?</p>

<p>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn</p>

<p>To adore the Conquerour?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who now beholds</p>

<p>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood</p>

<p>With scatter&#39;d Arms and Ensigns, till anon</p>

<p>His swift pursuers from Heav&#39;n Gates discern</p>

<p>Th&#39; advantage, and descending tread us down</p>

<p>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts</p>

<p>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.</p>

<p>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall&#39;n.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung</p>

<p>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch</p>

<p>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,</p>

<p>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.</p>

<p>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight</p>

<p>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;</p>

<p>Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd</p>

<p>Innumerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the potent Rod</p>

<p>Of <em>Amrams</em> Son in <em>Egypts</em> evill day</p>

<p>Wav&#39;d round the Coast, up call&#39;d a pitchy cloud</p>

<p>Of <em>Locusts</em>, warping on the Eastern Wind,</p>

<p>That ore the Realm of impious <em>Pharaoh</em> hung</p>

<p>Like Night, and darken&#39;d all the Land of <em>Nile</em>:</p>

<p>So numberless were those bad Angels seen</p>

<p>Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell</p>

<p>&#39;Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;</p>

<p>Till, as a signal giv&#39;n, th&#39; uplifted Spear</p>

<p>Of thir great Sultan waving to direct</p>

<p>Thir course, in even ballance down they light</p>

<p>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;</p>

<p>A multitude, like which the populous North</p>

<p>Pour&#39;d never from her frozen loyns, to pass</p>

<p><em>Rhene</em> or the <em>Danaw</em>, when her barbarous Sons</p>

<p>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread</p>

<p>Beneath <em>Gibralter</em> to the <em>Lybian</em> sands.</p>

<p>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band</p>

<p>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood</p>

<p>Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms</p>

<p>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,</p>

<p>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;</p>

<p>Though of thir Names in heav&#39;nly Records now</p>

<p>Be no memorial blotted out and ras&#39;d</p>

<p>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.</p>

<p>Nor had they yet among the Sons of <em>Eve</em></p>

<p>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,</p>

<p>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,</p>

<p>By falsities and lyes the greatest part</p>

<p>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake</p>

<p>God thir Creator, and th&#39; invisible</p>

<p>Glory of him that made them, to transform</p>

<p>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn&#39;d</p>

<p>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,</p>

<p>And Devils to adore for Deities:</p>

<p>Then were they known to men by various Names,</p>

<p>And various Idols through the Heathen World.</p>

<p>Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,</p>

<p>Rous&#39;d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,</p>

<p>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth</p>

<p>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,</p>

<p>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?</p>

<p>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell</p>

<p>Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix</p>

<p>Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,</p>

<p>Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador&#39;d</p>

<p>Among the Nations round, and durst abide</p>

<p><em>Jehovah</em> thundring out of <em>Sion</em>, thron&#39;d</p>

<p>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac&#39;d</p>

<p>Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,</p>

<p>Abominations; and with cursed things</p>

<p>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan&#39;d,</p>

<p>And with thir darkness durst affront his light.</p>

<p>First <em>Moloch</em>, horrid King besmear&#39;d with blood</p>

<p>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,</p>

<p>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud</p>

<p>Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire</p>

<p>To his grim Idol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him the <em>Ammonite</em></p>

<p>Worshipt in <em>Rabba</em> and her watry Plain,</p>

<p>In <em>Argob</em> and in <em>Basan</em>, to the stream</p>

<p>Of utmost <em>Arnon</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not content with such</p>

<p>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart</p>

<p>Of <em>Solomon</em> he led by fraud to build</p>

<p>His Temple right against the Temple of God</p>

<p>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove</p>

<p>The pleasant Vally of <em>Hinnom</em>, <em>Tophet</em> thence</p>

<p>And black <em>Gehenna</em> call&#39;d, the Type of Hell.</p>

<p>Next <em>Chemos</em>, th&#39; obscene dread of <em>Moabs</em> Sons,</p>

<p>From <em>Aroar</em> to <em>Nebo</em>, and the wild</p>

<p>Of Southmost <em>Abarim</em>; in <em>Hesebon</em></p>

<p>And <em>Heronaim</em>, <em>Seons</em> Realm, beyond</p>

<p>The flowry Dale of <em>Sibma</em> clad with Vines,</p>

<p>And <em>Eleale</em> to th&#39; <em>Asphaltick</em> Pool.</p>

<p><em>Peor</em> his other Name, when he entic&#39;d</p>

<p><em>Israel</em> in <em>Sittim</em> on thir march from <em>Nile</em></p>

<p>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.</p>

<p>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg&#39;d</p>

<p>Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove</p>

<p>Of <em>Moloch</em> homicide, lust hard by hate;</p>

<p>Till good <em>Josiah</em> drove them hence to Hell.</p>

<p>With these cam they, who from the bordring flood</p>

<p>Of old <em>Euphrates</em> to the Brook that parts</p>

<p><em>Egypt</em> from <em>Syrian</em> ground, had general names</p>

<p>Of <em>Baalim</em> and <em>Ashtaroth</em>, those male,</p>

<p>These Feminine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Spirits when they please</p>

<p>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft</p>

<p>And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,</p>

<p>Nor ti&#39;d or manacl&#39;d with joynt or limb,</p>

<p>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</p>

<p>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose</p>

<p>Dilated or condens&#39;t, bright or obscure,</p>

<p>Can execute thir aerie purposes,</p>

<p>And works of love or enmity fulfill.</p>

<p>For those the Race of <em>Israel</em> oft forsook</p>

<p>Thir living strength, and unfrequented left</p>

<p>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</p>

<p>To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low</p>

<p>Bow&#39;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</p>

<p>Of despicable foes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these in troop</p>

<p>Came <em>Astoreth</em>, whom the <em>Phoenicians</em> call&#39;d</p>

<p><em>Astarte</em>, Queen of Heav&#39;n, with crescent Horns;</p>

<p>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</p>

<p><em>Sidonian</em> Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,</p>

<p>In <em>Sion</em> also not unsung, where stood</p>

<p>Her Temple on th&#39; offensive Mountain, built</p>

<p>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</p>

<p>Beguil&#39;d by fair Idolatresses, fell</p>

<p>To idols foul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Thammuz</em> came next behind,</p>

<p>Whose annual wound in <em>Lebanon</em> allur&#39;d</p>

<p>The <em>Syrian</em> Damsels to lament his fate</p>

<p>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</p>

<p>While smooth <em>Adonis</em> from his native Rock</p>

<p>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&#39;d with blood</p>

<p>Of <em>Thammuz</em> yearly wounded; the Love-tale</p>

<p>Infected <em>Sions</em> daughters with like heat,</p>

<p>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</p>

<p><em>Ezekial</em> saw, when by the Vision led</p>

<p>His eye survay&#39;d the dark Idolatries</p>

<p>Of alienated <em>Judah</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came one</p>

<p>Who mourn&#39;d in earnest, when the Captive Ark</p>

<p>Maim&#39;d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</p>

<p>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</p>

<p>Where he fell flat, and sham&#39;d his Worshipers:</p>

<p><em>Dagon</em> his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</p>

<p>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</p>

<p>Rear&#39;d in <em>Azotus</em>, dreaded through the Coast</p>

<p>Of <em>Palestine</em>, in <em>Gath</em> and <em>Ascalon</em></p>

<p>And <em>Accaron</em> and <em>Gaza</em>&#39;s frontier bounds.</p>

<p>Him follow&#39;d <em>Rimmon</em>, whose delightful Seat</p>

<p>Was fair <em>Damascus</em>, on the fertil Banks</p>

<p>Of <em>Abbana</em> and <em>Pharphar</em>, lucid streams.</p>

<p>He also against the house of God was bold:</p>

<p>A Leper once he lost and gain&#39;d a King,</p>

<p><em>Ahaz</em> his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</p>

<p>Gods Altar to disparage and displace</p>

<p>For one of <em>Syrian</em> mode, whereon to burn</p>

<p>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</p>

<p>Whom he had vanquisht.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these appear&#39;d</p>

<p>A crew who under Names of old Renown,</p>

<p><em>Osiris</em>, <em>Isis</em>, <em>Orus</em> and thir Train</p>

<p>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus&#39;d</p>

<p>Fanatic <em>Egypt</em> and her Priests, to seek</p>

<p>Thir wandring Gods Disguis&#39;d in brutish forms</p>

<p>Rather then human.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did <em>Israel</em> scape</p>

<p>Th&#39; infection when thir borrow&#39;d Gold compos&#39;d</p>

<p>The Calf in <em>Oreb</em>: and the Rebel King</p>

<p>Doubl&#39;d that sin in <em>Bethel</em> and in <em>Dan</em>,</p>

<p>Lik&#39;ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</p>

<p><em>Jehovah</em>, who in one Night when he pass&#39;d</p>

<p>From <em>Egypt</em> marching, equal&#39;d with one stroke</p>

<p>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods</p>

<p><em>Belial</em> came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</p>

<p>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</p>

<p>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</p>

<p>Or Altar smoak&#39;d; yet who more oft then hee</p>

<p>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</p>

<p>Turns Atheist, as did <em>Ely&#39;s</em> Sons, who fill&#39;d</p>

<p>With lust and violence the house of God.</p>

<p>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</p>

<p>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</p>

<p>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</p>

<p>And injury and outrage: And when Night</p>

<p>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</p>

<p>Of <em>Belial</em>, flown with insolence and wine.</p>

<p>Witness the Streets of <em>Sodom</em>, and that night</p>

<p>In <em>Gibeah</em>, when the hospitable door</p>

<p>Expos&#39;d a Matron to avoid worse rape.</p>

<p>These were the prime in order and in might;</p>

<p>The rest were long to tell, though far renown&#39;d,</p>

<p>Th&#39; <em>Ionian</em> Gods, of <em>Javans</em> issue held</p>

<p>Gods, yet confest later then Heav&#39;n and Earth</p>

<p>Thir boasted Parents; <em>Titan</em> Heav&#39;ns first born</p>

<p>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis&#39;d</p>

<p>By younger <em>Saturn</em>, he from mightier <em>Jove</em></p>

<p>His own and <em>Rhea&#39;s</em> Son like measure found;</p>

<p>So <em>Jove</em> usurping reign&#39;d: these first in <em>Creet</em></p>

<p>And <em>Ida</em> known, thence on the Snowy top</p>

<p>Of cold <em>Olympus</em> rul&#39;d the middle Air</p>

<p>Thir highest Heav&#39;n; or on the <em>Delphian</em> Cliff,</p>

<p>Or in <em>Dodona</em>, and through all the bounds</p>

<p>Of <em>Doric</em> Land; or who with <em>Saturn</em> old</p>

<p>Fled over <em>Adria</em> to th&#39; <em>Hesperian</em> Fields,</p>

<p>And ore the <em>Celtic</em> roam&#39;d the utmost Isles.</p>

<p>All these and more came flocking; but with looks</p>

<p>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear&#39;d</p>

<p>Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief</p>

<p>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost</p>

<p>In loss itself; which on his count&#39;nance cast</p>

<p>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</p>

<p>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</p>

<p>Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais&#39;d</p>

<p>Thir fanting courage, and dispel&#39;d thir fears.</p>

<p>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</p>

<p>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard</p>

<p>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim&#39;d</p>

<p><em>Azazel</em> as his right, a Cherube tall:</p>

<p>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld</p>

<p>Th&#39; Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc&#39;t</p>

<p>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind</p>

<p>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz&#39;d,</p>

<p>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while</p>

<p>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:</p>

<p>At which the universal Host upsent</p>

<p>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond</p>

<p>Frighted the Reign of <em>Chaos</em> and old Night.</p>

<p>All in a moment through the gloom were seen</p>

<p>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</p>

<p>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose</p>

<p>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms</p>

<p>Appear&#39;d, and serried Shields in thick array</p>

<p>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move</p>

<p>In perfect <em>Phalanx</em> to the <em>Dorian</em> mood</p>

<p>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais&#39;d</p>

<p>To hight of noblest temper Hero&#39;s old</p>

<p>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage</p>

<p>Deliberate valour breath&#39;d, firm and unmov&#39;d</p>

<p>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,</p>

<p>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</p>

<p>With solemn touches, troubl&#39;d thoughts, and chase</p>

<p>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</p>

<p>From mortal or immortal minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they</p>

<p>Breathing united force with fixed thought</p>

<p>Mov&#39;d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm&#39;d</p>

<p>Thir painful steps o&#39;re the burnt soyle; and now</p>

<p>Advanc&#39;t in view, they stand, a horrid Front</p>

<p>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise</p>

<p>Of Warriers old with order&#39;d Spear and Shield,</p>

<p>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief</p>

<p>Had to impose: He through the armed Files</p>

<p>Darts his experienc&#39;t eye, and soon traverse</p>

<p>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,</p>

<p>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,</p>

<p>Thir number last he summs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now his heart</p>

<p>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength</p>

<p>Glories: For never since created man,</p>

<p>Met such imbodied force, as nam&#39;d with these</p>

<p>Could merit more then that small infantry</p>

<p>Warr&#39;d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood</p>

<p>Of <em>Phlegra</em> with th&#39; Heroic Race were joyn&#39;d</p>

<p>That fought at <em>Theb&#39;s</em> and <em>Ilium</em>, on each side</p>

<p>Mixt with auxiliar Gods;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what resounds</p>

<p>In Fable or <em>Romance</em> of <em>Uthers</em> Sons</p>

<p>Begirt with <em>British</em> and <em>Armoric</em> Knights;</p>

<p>And all who since Baptiz&#39;d or Infidel</p>

<p>Jousted in <em>Aspramont</em> or <em>Montalban</em>,</p>

<p><em>Damasco</em>, or <em>Marocco</em>, or <em>Trebisond</em></p>

<p>Or whom <em>Biserta</em> sent from <em>Afric</em> shore</p>

<p>When <em>Charlemain</em> with all his Peerage fell</p>

<p>By <em>Fontarabbia</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far these beyond</p>

<p>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ&#39;d</p>

<p>Thir dread commander: he above the rest</p>

<p>In shape and gesture proudly eminent</p>

<p>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost</p>

<p>All her Original brightness, nor appear&#39;d</p>

<p>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th&#39; excess</p>

<p>Of Glory obscur&#39;d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the Sun new ris&#39;n</p>

<p>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air</p>

<p>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon</p>

<p>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</p>

<p>On half the Nations, and with fear of change</p>

<p>Perplexes Monarch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark&#39;n&#39;d so, yet shon</p>

<p>Above them all th&#39; Arch Angel; but his face</p>

<p>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</p>

<p>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</p>

<p>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</p>

<p>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</p>

<p>Signs of remorse and passion to behold</p>

<p>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</p>

<p>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn&#39;d</p>

<p>For ever now to have thir lot in pain,</p>

<p>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc&#39;t</p>

<p>Of Heav&#39;n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</p>

<p>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</p>

<p>Thir Glory witherd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when Heavens Fire</p>

<p>Hath scath&#39;d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,</p>

<p>With singed top thir stately growth though bare</p>

<p>Stands on the blasted Heath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now prepar&#39;d</p>

<p>To speak; whereat thir doubl&#39;d Ranks they bend</p>

<p>From wing to wing, and half enclose him round</p>

<p>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.</p>

<p>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,</p>

<p>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</p>

<p>Words interwove with sighs found out thir way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers</p>

<p>Matchless, but with th&#39; Almighty, and that strife</p>

<p>Was not inglorious, though th&#39; event was dire,</p>

<p>As this place testifies, and this dire change</p>

<p>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind</p>

<p>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth</p>

<p>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&#39;d,</p>

<p>How such united force of Gods, how such</p>

<p>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</p>

<p>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,</p>

<p>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile</p>

<p>Hath emptied Heav&#39;n, shall fail to re-ascend</p>

<p>Self-rais&#39;d, and repossess thir native seat?</p>

<p>For mee be witness all the Host of Heav&#39;n,</p>

<p>If counsels different, or danger shun&#39;d</p>

<p>By mee, have lost our hopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he who reigns</p>

<p>Monarch in Heav&#39;n, till then as one secure</p>

<p>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,</p>

<p>Consent or custome, and his Regal State</p>

<p>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&#39;d,</p>

<p>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</p>

<p>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</p>

<p>So as not either to provoke, or dread</p>

<p>New warr, provok&#39;t; our better part remains</p>

<p>To work in close design, by fraud or guile</p>

<p>What force effected not: that he no less</p>

<p>At length from us may find, who overcomes</p>

<p>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.</p>

<p>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</p>

<p>There went a fame in Heav&#39;n that he ere long</p>

<p>Intended to create, and therein plant</p>

<p>A generation, whom his choice regard</p>

<p>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</p>

<p>Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps</p>

<p>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</p>

<p>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</p>

<p>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th&#39; Abyss</p>

<p>Long under darkness cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thoughts</p>

<p>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</p>

<p>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr</p>

<p>Open or understood must be resolv&#39;d.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</p>

<p>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</p>

<p>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</p>

<p>Far round illumin&#39;d hell: highly they rag&#39;d</p>

<p>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms</p>

<p>Clash&#39;d on thir sounding Shields the din of war,</p>

<p>Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav&#39;n.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There stood a hill not far whose griesly top</p>

<p>Belch&#39;d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</p>

<p>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</p>

<p>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</p>

<p>The work of Sulphur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither wing&#39;d with speed</p>

<p>A numerous Brigad hasten&#39;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when Bands</p>

<p>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm&#39;d</p>

<p>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</p>

<p>Or cast a Rampart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Mammon</em> led them on,</p>

<p><em>Mammon</em>, the least erected Spirit that fell</p>

<p>From heav&#39;n, for ev&#39;n in heav&#39;n his looks and thoughts</p>

<p>Were always downward bent, admiring more</p>

<p>The riches of Heav&#39;ns pavement, trod&#39;n Gold,</p>

<p>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&#39;d</p>

<p>In vision beatific: by him first</p>

<p>Men also, and by his suggestion taught</p>

<p>Ransack&#39;d the Center, and with impious hands</p>

<p>Rifl&#39;d the bowels of thir mother Earth</p>

<p>For Treasures better hid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon had his crew</p>

<p>Op&#39;nd into the Hill a spacious wound</p>

<p>And dig&#39;d out ribs of Gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none admire</p>

<p>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best</p>

<p>Deserve the precious bane.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here let those</p>

<p>Who boast in mortal things, and wond&#39;ring tell</p>

<p>Of <em>Babel</em>, and the works of <em>Memphian</em> Kings</p>

<p>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,</p>

<p>And Strength and Art are easily out-done</p>

<p>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</p>

<p>What in an age they with incessant toyle</p>

<p>And hands innumerable scarce perform.</p>

<p>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar&#39;d</p>

<p>That underneath had veins of liquid fire</p>

<p>Sluc&#39;d from the Lake, a second multitude</p>

<p>With wond&#39;rous Art found out the massie Ore,</p>

<p>Severing each kind, and scum&#39;d the Bullion dross:</p>

<p>A third as soon had form&#39;d within the ground</p>

<p>A various mould, and from the boyling cells</p>

<p>By strange conveyance fill&#39;d each hollow nook,</p>

<p>As in an Organ from one blast of wind</p>

<p>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.</p>

<p>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</p>

<p>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound</p>

<p>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,</p>

<p>Built like a Temple, where <em>Pilasters</em> round</p>

<p>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</p>

<p>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want</p>

<p>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&#39;n,</p>

<p>The Roof was fretted Gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not <em>Babilon</em>,</p>

<p>Nor great <em>Alcairo</em> such magnificence</p>

<p>Equal&#39;d in all thir glories, to inshrine</p>

<p><em>Belus</em> or <em>Serapis</em> thir Gods, or seat</p>

<p>Thir Kings, when <em>Aegypt</em> with <em>Assyria</em> strove</p>

<p>In wealth and luxurie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th&#39; ascending pile</p>

<p>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores</p>

<p>Op&#39;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide</p>

<p>Within, her ample spaces, o&#39;re the smooth</p>

<p>And level pavement: from the arched roof</p>

<p>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row</p>

<p>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed</p>

<p>With <em>Naphtha</em> and <em>Asphaltus</em> yeilded light</p>

<p>As from a sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hasty multitude</p>

<p>Admiring enter&#39;d, and the work some praise</p>

<p>And some the Architect: his hand was known</p>

<p>In Heav&#39;n by many a Towred structure high,</p>

<p>Where Scepter&#39;d Angels held thir residence,</p>

<p>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</p>

<p>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</p>

<p>Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.</p>

<p>Nor was his name unheard or unador&#39;d</p>

<p>In ancient <em>Greece</em>; and in <em>Ausonian</em> land</p>

<p>Men call&#39;d him <em>Mulciber</em>; and how he fell</p>

<p>From Heav&#39;n, they fabl&#39;d, thrown by angry <em>Jove</em></p>

<p>Sheer o&#39;re the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn</p>

<p>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,</p>

<p>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun</p>

<p>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</p>

<p>On <em>Lemnos</em> th&#39; <em>Aegaean</em> Ile: thus they relate,</p>

<p>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</p>

<p>Fell long before; nor aught avail&#39;d him now</p>

<p>To have built in Heav&#39;n high Towrs; nor did he scape</p>

<p>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent</p>

<p>With his industrious crew to build in hell.</p>

<p>Mean while the winged Haralds by command</p>

<p>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony</p>

<p>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim</p>

<p>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held</p>

<p>At <em>Pandaemonium</em>, the high Capital</p>

<p>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call&#39;d</p>

<p>From every Band and squared Regiment</p>

<p>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon</p>

<p>With hunderds and with thousands trooping came</p>

<p>Attended: all access was throng&#39;d, the Gates</p>

<p>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall</p>

<p>(Though like a cover&#39;d field, where Champions bold</p>

<p>Wont ride in arm&#39;d, and at the Soldans chair</p>

<p>Defi&#39;d the best of <em>Panim</em> chivalry</p>

<p>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)</p>

<p>Thick swarm&#39;d, both on the ground and in the air,</p>

<p>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bees</p>

<p>In spring time, when the Sun with <em>Taurus</em> rides,</p>

<p>Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive</p>

<p>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers</p>

<p>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,</p>

<p>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,</p>

<p>New rub&#39;d with Baum, expatiate and confer</p>

<p>Thir State affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thick the aerie crowd</p>

<p>Swarm&#39;d and were straitn&#39;d; till the Signal giv&#39;n</p>

<p>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd</p>

<p>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons</p>

<p>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room</p>

<p>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race</p>

<p>Beyond the <em>Indian</em> Mount, or Faerie Elves,</p>

<p>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side</p>

<p>Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,</p>

<p>Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon</p>

<p>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth</p>

<p>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance</p>

<p>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;</p>

<p>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</p>

<p>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</p>

<p>Reduc&#39;d thir shapes immense, and were at large,</p>

<p>Though without number still amidst the Hall</p>

<p>Of that infernal Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But far within</p>

<p>And in thir own dimensions like themselves</p>

<p>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</p>

<p>In close recess and secret conclave sat</p>

<p>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat&#39;s,</p>

<p>Frequent and full.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After short silence then</p>

<p>And summons read, the great consult began.</p>
